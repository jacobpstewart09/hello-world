# hello-world
Here's to creating my first GitHub repository!
My favorite color is red, I love cats, hate dogs, and think everyone
oughta know that Alanis M. is the bomb!

Mr. Leo is da seeeeweet kidden, and Alana is da fluffums.
They do me the solid of keeping my keyboard and computer chair warm
while I'm away.

When they're not working their warming shifts, they spend most of their time
teaching me new keyboard shortcuts.
